AUVSI: 

Ability to export telemtry data into xml/csv with whatever data you want:
	GPS
	Altitude

	Battery Level
	Time
	Etc..
	
Import/Export waypoints, search areas, boundaries, obstacles (moving obstacle paths + gps coordinates)
	


Add points of interest through clicking, or pressing a key on the keyboard
